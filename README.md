# OutrunAI
A supervised machine learning model designed to play the classic 1986 arcade game Outrun, implemented in Python 3.

## Design
The majority of the code is used for interacting with the game, and pre-trained learning models are provided. The normal execution of the game-playing loop follows a three step process:

Extract features --> Fit learning model --> Simulate controller input

## Learning Algorithms
Two supervised learning models have been implemented: a Decision Tree and a Multilayer Perceptron.
